# About

Mellow is an experimental music player, which strives for maximal immersion with
minimal distraction. Elements of the interface are purposefully abstracted away,
letting music be the central point of focus.

> [!CAUTION]
> This software is in active development. Certain features may be missing, buggy, or
> incomplete. See the [Roadmap](#roadmap), [QA.md](QA.md), and [TODO.md](TODO.md) for
> more details.

# Philosophy

Mellow's primary design goal is to minimize distraction and maximize immersion,
and with that encourage experiencing the music in-the-moment.

Unlike most players, Mellow puts the currently playing song at the base of the
interface. This means that there is no "back" button on the main player, which
might be tempting to press. Rather, everything that is unrelated to the currently
playing song is done inside an overlay, hidden from view except when needed.

This divides the interface into two parts; the main player (the "now"), and the
overlay (the "not now"). The main player features the currently playing song and
player controls, and the overlay is used for everything else; browsing the library
to find what to play, editing the song queue to choose what plays next, setting the
shuffle and repeat modes, and configuring the application.
When the overlay is closed, it is time to enjoy the music.

# Features

- ✨ Sleek and minimal interface - less for the eyes, more for the ears
- 🌈 Adaptive colors - interface colors adapt to match the album cover
- 🌊 Gapless playback - enjoy stutter-free transitions between songs
- 📋 Song queue - view and edit the list of playing songs, or schedule a pause
- 📀 Music library - browse and play your local music collection
- 📂 File discovery - detects changed, moved, removed, or added song files
- 💾 Removable drives - ratings can be accessed once the library is available again
- 🪽 Fast & lightweight - responsive and quick to start, even with large libraries

# Installing Mellow

> [!NOTE]
> Only Linux builds are currently supported. If you would like to try Mellow on
> a different operating system, it may be possible by building it from source.

The recommended way to install Mellow is by downloading it from the
[releases page](https://github.com/Userwithaname/mellow/releases).
It can be installed by opening the Flatpak file in Gnome Software
(or similar), or using the `flatpak` command from the terminal:

```bash
# Note: Check if the path is correct before running
flatpak install --user ~/Downloads/io.github.userwithaname.Mellow.flatpak
```

# Uninstalling

If you've installed Mellow using the Flatpak release asset and wish to remove it,
you can either do so through your distribution's software manager, or by using the
`flatpak` command from the terminal:

```bash
flatpak uninstall io.github.userwithaname.Mellow
```

If you've installed Mellow by building it from source, it can be uninstalled by
manually removing the files listed at the bottom of this document.

# Building from source

> [!NOTE]
> The below instructions are meant for Fedora;
> steps may be different for other systems

## Step 1: Installing dependencies

### [Rust & Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/on-linux.html), [GTK](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/stable/latest/book/project_setup.html), [Libadwaita](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/stable/latest/book/libadwaita.html), and [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/SimpleStart.html#installing-meson):

```bash
dnf install gstreamer1-devel gtk4-devel libadwaita-devel meson
```

> [!TIP]
> Mellow may also be built using [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-build.html)
> directly by adding `--feature no-meson`. Note that this will require manually
> [installing the GSchema](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/stable/latest/book/settings.html),
> setting up icons, and creating the application shortcut. Building with Meson
> is recommended for a simpler build process.

### Recommended plugins (not required for building):

```bash
dnf install \
  gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free \
  gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free-extras \
  gstreamer1-plugins-good \
  gstreamer1-plugins-good-extras \
  gstreamer1-plugin-libav
```

## Step 2: Building and installing

### [Build using Meson](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/stable/latest/book/meson.html#building-and-running):

Clone the source code and run the following command to build and
install Mellow on your system:

```bash
meson setup builddir --prefix=~/.local && meson install -C builddir
```

The following files and directories will be created:
```
~
├── .cache
│   └── mellow ⟵╮
│       └── …  ⟵┤

        └── mellow
            └── resources.gresource
```

> [!TIP]
> Ensure the `mellow` executable is within your `$PATH` for the shortcut to
> work correctly. If you've used a different build command, the executable
> might be in a different location than shown above.
